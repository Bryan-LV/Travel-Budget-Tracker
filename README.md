# TripWallet

Tripwallet is a web app that helps users traveling around the world and in their own back yards keep track of their expenses along the way.

Create a trip and make categories that you see fit for your travels. With a built in currency conversion API, a user does not need to worry about making the conversions before they add it to their budget. Simply add the expense in the foreign currency you are using and the expense will be converted to your base currency and tracked to your budget.
